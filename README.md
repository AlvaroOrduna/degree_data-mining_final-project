__Author:__ [Álvaro Orduna León](https://github.com/AlvaroOrduna) & [Carl Rodriguez](https://github.com/carl12)

__Description:__ Final project for the subject Data mining imparted in the Degree of Computer Science from the Public University of Navarra (UPNA)

### Structure

* __data:__     train and test datasets
* __res:__      teacher resources
* __results:__  results obtained in different executions
* __src:__      implementation of different algorithms and the main script

### Usage

To run any of the algorithms implemented, simply change the variable `algorithm` form `src\main.m` and run the script.
The accepted values for the variable `algorithm` are the names of these folders in `src`.

The __`src\main.m`__ script is responsible for __loading the data, standardize, run the selected algorithm and save the results__.
